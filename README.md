# Slices

A library of useful functions for operating on slices in Go.

This is a library aimed at making it easier to work with slices in Go. Slices was inspired from Lodash and my experiences in other programming languages such as Kotlin, Java, C#, etc. 

## Getting the Library

This library requires Go 1.18+
